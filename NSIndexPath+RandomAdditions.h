@interface NSIndexPath (RandomAdditions)

+ (NSIndexPath *)randomIndexPathInArrays:(NSArray *)arrays
                     excludingIndexPaths:(NSSet *)excludedIndexPaths;
// Returns a random index path valid for one of the arrays in arrays. The returned
// index path will not be in the set of excludedIndexPaths.
//
// The order of the arrays in arrays is important. The first array is section 0, the
// second array is section 1, and so on. The size of the arrays can vary but an array
// cannot be empty.
//
// Returns nil if:
//      - arrays is nil
//      - any of the arrays in arrays is empty
//      - any of the objects in arrays is not an array
//      - the number of items in excludedIndexPaths is greater than or equal to the
//          total number of elements for all the arrays in arrays
//
// arrays must be an array of arrays. If not you'll get an unrecognized selector error.
//
// This method will take longer to return as the number of items in excludedIndexPaths
// grows as a percent of the total number of elements for all the arrays in arrays.
